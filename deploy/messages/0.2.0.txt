Select the correct tar file for your operating system. Currently, only 64-bit
versions for OSX and Ubuntu are available. Download the attached tar file, 
extract it, and put the resulting folder in the Packages folder of 
Sublime Text 3.

The packages folder for OSX is

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages

The packages folder for Linux is

    ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages

The "Linux" version might work on distributions other than Ubuntu, but I haven't
tested that.
